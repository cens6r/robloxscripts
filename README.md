## script not working?
its probably because i made an archive of a loadstring, and then changed the original files directory. if theres an original url as a comment, use it. if it doesnt work or it doesnt exist use githubs search feature to try finding the original url and use that instead. sorry if this causes any inconviniences, feel free to open a pull request to help me and everyone else.

## credits
all scripts credits go to their respective owners, most scripts should have a credit section at the top. if there isn't one open a pull request and ill merge it

## removals
is your script on here and you want it removed? open an issue with proof of you owning the script and i will remove it swiftly.
