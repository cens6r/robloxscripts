# Elerium UI Library v2
[original verm thread](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=959294)
<br>
Hello everyone!
<br>
I have decided to release my (previously private) UI library!
<br>
The reason I am releasing this is for two reasons:
<br>
1) Some people (which was not invited to Elerium) got hold of the source, and literally stealing credits.
<br>
2) I would like to give everyone the opportunity to use this :)
